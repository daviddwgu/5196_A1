<title> The age of the Samurai</title>
<synopsis> The unit explores the history of Japan and East Asia via an examination of the figure of the samurai. The focus is broadly on the period from 1185 to 1867 when Japan was ruled by a succession of warrior regimes but the unit will also explore the evolution of samurai images and representations primarily in film but also in books, anime, manga, and video games. The central concern is with the evolution of the figure of the samurai across this long period and with the constant tensions between the ideals put forward about the way of the warrior and the actual realities of samurai life.  We will explore the samurai from varied perspectives by considering questions of status, identity, politics, gender, and economics.</synopsis>

<title> European integration and security</title>
<synopsis> War and security have been crucial motors of international relations, not least in Europe the birthplace of the Westphalian state system. The European Union is commonly seen to have been an antidote to war, ushering in an era of Kantian peace; a view powerfully endorsed by the awarding of the Nobel Prize to the EU in 2012. Despite the strength of this view, recent research suggests it is possible to look at the relationship between peace and European unity differently. In fact, European unity has been propelled by war since 1945: not just at the founding moment at the end of the Second World War (NATO, EEC, WEU), but by anti-colonial nationalists pushing European powers towards pro-active European policies, and in EU responses to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia (OSCE, CFSP), Iraq, Libya and the challenges posed by refugee movements and global terrorism. An unintended consequence of the logic of deeper integration has been the consolidation of a European identity amongst some elites, whilst political and popular support for the EU has weakened. This last development poses serious questions about the future shape the state system in what remains a major player in regimes of global governance and security.</synopsis>

The unit will have a specific focus on World War 2, the Italian Resistance, and the massacre of civilians in Tuscany and Emilia Romagna. The unit will consider how written and visual responses to these events, material forms of remembrance - monuments, memorials, museums,  and cemeteries in, or within reach of Prato - each function to memorialise the dead and how in articulating political and national ideologies, such sites acknowledge and incorporate countervailing ideologies and the contradictory testimony of survivors. The unit will unpack, examine and critique the complex inter-relations between media, memory and war, exploring how in pursuit of specific political and cultural goals, memories of conflict are created, constructed and recovered through an array of artistic and memorial forms. Students will be invited to move beyond a purely theoretical understanding of these issues by visiting museums, massacre sites and their memorials, examining and critiquing their mediation and creating a critical/creative response to one such site.</synopsis>

<title> Immunology in health and disease</title>
<synopsis> The immune system has a central role in many aspects of health and disease in both humans and animals. While the immune system is critical for protecting us from pathogens, it also has an important role in cancer surveillance and is the reason why tissue transplantation is difficult to achieve. Many debilitating conditions such as allergy and autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis are caused by the immune system. This unit progresses from IMM2011 which focused on the development and structure of the immune system and immune response to now examine the broad role of the immune system in a range of disease and health states. By selecting a range of real life examples, we can not only examine the nature of how the immune system is active but also broaden our understanding of social and ethical implications and the role that medical research has towards improving outcomes. This unit will give students the opportunity to learn how immunology is important in many aspects of our society while developing and reinforcing a range of academic skills through defined teaching and assessment tasks.</synopsis>

<title> History of philosophy: Emotions</title>
<synopsis> The unit will examine issues to do with emotions in the history of philosophy. In the pre-modern era, the emotions or 'passions', such as love, desire, fear, and sadness, were seen as mental states that arose involuntarily in the soul as a result of its close connection with the body. They were commonly regarded as corrupting influences on an agent's moral choices and actions. To overcome their influence, philosophers recommended various techniques for either suppressing the passions or turning them into virtues or excellences of character. Following the Augustinian tradition, many regarded love as the key to transforming the passions. This unit explores the moral and metaphysical dimensions of this subject, with reference to both male and female philosophers of the past. Some of the thinkers who may be discussed include St Augustine, Rene Descartes, Elisabeth of Bohemia, Mary Astell, and David Hume. Some of the themes in the unit may be followed into contemporary philosophical discussions.</synopsis>

<title> People management and work in a global context</title>
<synopsis> This unit analyses national differences in how people and work are managed in terms of the historical, economic, legal, political and cultural factors associated with national differences and similarities in the employment regulatory environment. Based on the premise that people are a source of competitive advantage for international organisations, employment and human resource management practices and strategies within multinational corporations are examined. Topics include; internationalisation and globalisation, divergence and convergence in national systems of employment relations in European, Anglophone and Asian countries, varieties of capitalism in these same regions, labour management practices in multinational corporations, corporate social responsibility and labour standards, regulatory and institutional differences governing the management of labour.</synopsis>

<title> Digital Humanities: Concepts, tools and debates</title>
<synopsis> This unit introduces students to central concepts at the intersection of the digital world and a range of humanistic endeavours. Through case studies based in each of the themes of the major, we examine how technological possibilities have interacted with recent work in scholarship, media and heritage studies allowing exciting new techniques and methods of research and presentation of data. We consider the bases necessary for such work, the data sources and the tools, and also investigate the new communicative possibilities that result. As well as critically engaging with existing applications in the field, students in this unit will  produce digital objects presenting their own work. Through exploring the impact of technological change in this field, the unit also will foster a more general understanding of such impacts and of the inter-relation of digital technologies, society and culture.</synopsis>

<title> Mechanics of materials</title>
<synopsis> This unit deals with the mechanical behaviour of solids subject to external loads. The basic principles of solid mechanics will be introduced, including kinematic relations, equilibrium equations and constitutive theories, in order to formulate a set of governing equations needed for solving general boundary value problems. In addition to presenting solution techniques, this unit puts emphasis on model development, since many problems in materials mechanics first require the formulation of modelling assumptions. Solid mechanics principles and modelling assumptions will be illustrated in a number of cases of practical engineering relevance, including axial and torsional loading of bars and bending of beams. Failure criteria for brittle and ductile materials (the yield criteria) will also be introduced.</synopsis>
