The central concern is with the evolution of the figure of the samurai across this long period and with the constant tensions between the ideals put forward about the way of the warrior and the actual realities of samurai life.  We will explore the samurai from varied perspectives by considering questions of status, identity, politics, gender, and economics.",

The European Union is commonly seen to have been an antidote to war, ushering in an era of Kantian peace; a view powerfully endorsed by the awarding of the Nobel Prize to the EU in 2012. Despite the strength of this view, recent research suggests it is possible to look at the relationship between peace and European unity differently. In fact, European unity has been propelled by war since 1945: not just at the founding moment at the end of the Second World War (NATO, EEC, WEU), but by anti-colonial nationalists pushing European powers towards pro-active European policies, and in EU responses to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia (OSCE, CFSP), Iraq, Libya and the challenges posed by refugee movements and global terrorism. An unintended consequence of the logic of deeper integration has been the consolidation of a European identity amongst some elites, whilst political and popular support for the EU has weakened. This last development poses serious questions about the future shape the state system in what remains a major player in regimes of global governance and security.",

While the immune system is critical for protecting us from pathogens, it also has an important role in cancer surveillance and is the reason why tissue transplantation is difficult to achieve. Many debilitating conditions such as allergy and autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis are caused by the immune system. This unit progresses from IMM2011 which focused on the development and structure of the immune system and immune response to now examine the broad role of the immune system in a range of disease and health states. By selecting a range of real life examples, we can not only examine the nature of how the immune system is active but also broaden our understanding of social and ethical implications and the role that medical research has towards improving outcomes. This unit will give students the opportunity to learn how immunology is important in many aspects of our society while developing and reinforcing a range of academic skills through defined teaching and assessment tasks.",

In the pre-modern era, the emotions or 'passions', such as love, desire, fear, and sadness, were seen as mental states that arose involuntarily in the soul as a result of its close connection with the body. They were commonly regarded as corrupting influences on an agent's moral choices and actions. To overcome their influence, philosophers recommended various techniques for either suppressing the passions or turning them into virtues or excellences of character. Following the Augustinian tradition, many regarded love as the key to transforming the passions. This unit explores the moral and metaphysical dimensions of this subject, with reference to both male and female philosophers of the past. Some of the thinkers who may be discussed include St Augustine, Rene Descartes, Elisabeth of Bohemia, Mary Astell, and David Hume. Some of the themes in the unit may be followed into contemporary philosophical discussions.",

The application of these techniques in forensic analysis is examined using examples such as the detection of accelerants at arson scenes, drug detection in sport and identification of micro samples at crime scenes.

As well as critically engaging with existing applications in the field, students in this unit will  produce digital objects presenting their own work.

Solid mechanics principles and modelling assumptions will be illustrated in a number of cases of practical engineering relevance, including axial and torsional loading of bars and bending of beams.
