<title> Catchment hydrology</title>
<synopsis> Water is one of the critical resources that supports human settlement and food production. This unit introduces the hydrological processes that distribute water through catchment areas and explores the way in which many human activities, such as the growth of urban areas, deforestation, and the use and control of fire, may disturb these processes. A series of laboratory classes introduce students to some of the technical aspects of hydrologic processes, such as nature and measurement of infiltration through soils, and the behaviour of groundwater and surface runoff.</synopsis>

<synopsis> Successful screen-based media productions start with an engaging story that has been skillfully envisaged. In this unit students will draw upon practical theories of screenwriting to transform real-world research into industry standard scripts for both non-fiction and fiction productions. The unit will introduce basic strategies for concept development and demonstrate how to write supporting 'short docs' such as synopsis, outlines and treatments. Students will then apply stylistic conventions and narrative theories of screenwriting to transform these into shoot-ready scripts for non-fiction and fiction media productions. Where possible, students will be given an opportunity to pitch their final scripts to industry professionals for constructive feedback.</synopsis>

<synopsis> Through seminars, workshops and fieldwork this unit will examine how conflict has been represented, remembered and memorialised. The unit will have a specific focus on World War 2, the Italian Resistance, and the massacre of civilians in Tuscany and Emilia Romagna. The unit will consider how written and visual responses to these events, material forms of remembrance - monuments, memorials, museums,  and cemeteries in, or within reach of Prato - each function to memorialise the dead and how in articulating political and national ideologies, such sites acknowledge and incorporate countervailing ideologies and the contradictory testimony of survivors. The unit will unpack, examine and critique the complex inter-relations between media, memory and war, exploring how in pursuit of specific political and cultural goals, memories of conflict are created, constructed and recovered through an array of artistic and memorial forms. Students will be invited to move beyond a purely theoretical understanding of these issues by visiting museums, massacre sites and their memorials, examining and critiquing their mediation and creating a critical/creative response to one such site.</synopsis>

<synopsis> The Bachelor of Occupational Therapy (Honours) research project program has been designed to enable students to effectively integrate research knowledge and skill with occupational therapy practice knowledge and skill. The program incorporates advanced education in qualitative and quantitative research methodologies through the development and completion of a research project. The research project undertaken will require students to formulate a research aim and/or question/s, complete a literature review, design an appropriate methodology to answer the research question/s, complete an ethics application, and gather and analyse the required data, discuss the results in relation to pertinent literature and professional practice, and develop conclusions and recommendations. The Honours program has been structured to enable students to understand research in the context of the issues of interest of concern in a specific organisation or service area. They will also develop an understanding of how the research project applies to the wider community. Hence each occupational therapy Honours project has a 'host' organisation which has a fieldwork responsibility.

Field visits to prisons, both low and high security facilities, will be undertaken, and the day-to-day challenges faced by prison staff will be discussed and reflected upon. The unit is inherently comparative, drawing on the Nordic exceptionalism thesis, and engages with a range of key issues around modern prison practice, such as design, security model, staff training, prisoners with cognitive disabilities, and terrorist suspects. It aims to identify best practice in a challenging and changing environment.</synopsis>

<title> Ethics and biotechnology</title>
<synopsis> The unit investigates how the law and public policy should respond to advances in medicine and biotechnology. The unit adopts a global perspective but looks at issues through a South African and African lens. Issues that are and covered includes: whether employers and insurance companies should be permitted to discriminate among applicants on the basis of their genetic profile; whether the law should protect individuals' genetic privacy or whether we have a duty to share our genetic knowledge; whether the law should act paternalistically to prevent people from harming themselves; whether people who are partly responsible for their own bad health should receive lower priority of care in hospitals, or whether advances in knowledge in the biological bases for behaviour give us reason to doubt individual responsibility. These issues are linked to the situation regarding bio-technology in South Africa and Africa in general, with particular reference to some of the ethical dilemmas encountered within this context.</synopsis>

<title> History of philosophy: Emotions</title>
<synopsis> The unit will examine issues to do with emotions in the history of philosophy. In the pre-modern era, the emotions or 'passions', such as love, desire, fear, and sadness, were seen as mental states that arose involuntarily in the soul as a result of its close connection with the body. They were commonly regarded as corrupting influences on an agent's moral choices and actions. To overcome their influence, philosophers recommended various techniques for either suppressing the passions or turning them into virtues or excellences of character. Following the Augustinian tradition, many regarded love as the key to transforming the passions. This unit explores the moral and metaphysical dimensions of this subject, with reference to both male and female philosophers of the past. Some of the thinkers who may be discussed include St Augustine, Rene Descartes, Elisabeth of Bohemia, Mary Astell, and David Hume. Some of the themes in the unit may be followed into contemporary philosophical discussions.</synopsis>

<title> Foundations of anatomy and physiology for health practice 2</title>
<synopsis> This unit is the second of the two units designed to familiarise health science students with the anatomical structures and physiological functions of the systems of the human body that underpin the regulatory mechanisms for homeostatic control. Students will be introduced to the structure and function of the cardiovascular, circulatory and respiratory systems together with their vital role in maintaining homeostasis. The key features of the lymphatic system and the properties of blood will be discussed. The unit will continue with a look at the importance of the endocrine system and its role in integrating various functions to control homeostasis. Students will be introduced to the key anatomical and physiological features of the urinary and digestive systems and the importance of maintaining pH and fluid balance within the body. Finally, students will be introduced to the reproductive systems, pregnancy and development. Throughout the unit, clinical connections will be made with the systems addressed so that students will understand the relevance of the topics included in the unit to the health and human science disciplines.</synopsis>

<title> Design thinking approaches</title>
<synopsis> This unit is developed to introduce non-cognate students in Masters courses to Design Thinking, and to its application within a wide range of problems and situations. These skills and strategies include a range of conceptual and communication approaches, ways to investigate and reconsider the context in which we work and live, as well as potential for innovation.  Design Thinking brings together some approaches that are known in the sciences and humanities, such as analysis and synthesis, but applies them in ways that are particular to a design approach.  Design Thinking can enable a more flexible approach to problems, and a more nuanced engagement with the complex issues of our contemporary world. This unit will introduce students to the key skills and practices associated with Design Thinking, and offer opportunities to explore the application of these basic creativity techniques. The course is delivered partly on-line, with lectures and workshops offering key activities supporting students' learning.</synopsis>

Intervention principles will also incorporate environmental supports and barriers (advocacy, organisational change, environmental adaptation) and evidence-based practice. The common characteristics of primary care will form the framework including issues of expanded access, multi-professional service teams, optimal service coordination, and a focus on patient empowerment and the application of technology to health promotion. Prevention and health promotion systems relevant to primary care will be examined, and the evidence and theoretical base for preventive (behavioural) counselling, brief interventions, health education practice, methods of tailoring strategies to client needs, motivational interviewing techniques, motivating change and preventing relapse will be explored.

<title> The body in contemporary art</title>
<synopsis> This unit concentrates on the artist's body in art, including photography, performance, painting, sculpture, video and multi-media art. It will consider ex les from the history of 20th century art but will focus primarily on art practice since 1960. The unit will deal with issues of identity, gender, sexuality and difference, drawing on performative theories of subjectivity. It will look closely at experimental art practices and how these practices have sought to close the gap between art and life; from the Happenings of the 1960s, through the body art of the 1960s and 70s, to relational aesthetics, and flash mob performance works in the 2000s. The unit will investigate live action in contrast to represented action, and will consider the live action and its remediation in video, digital art and film.</synopsis>

<title> Crime and inequality</title>
<synopsis> In this unit students explore the contemporary and historical significance of 'difference' in structuring patterns of law making, offending, victimisation, criminal justice system responses and experiences. Students are introduced to theoretical paradigms and empirical approaches for identifying and understanding marginalisation and inequality in society. Students are taught how to identify and draw connections between broader societal experiences of inequality and marginalisation and the development and orientation of systems of law and criminal justice. The unit focuses on factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, (dis)ability, regional inequalities, income and wealth distribution, social class, and homelessness, and examines how current patterns of social and economic inequality contribute to the disproportionate victimisation and criminalisation of certain marginalised populations in society.</synopsis>

<title> Writing resistance: Understanding the power of Indigenous story-telling through literature</title>
<synopsis> The unit will explore and examine the critical importance of Literature in developing an understanding of Indigenous story-telling and Indigeneity across the world. Students will gain an appreciation of the ways in which Indigenous literatures tell the stories of Indigenous peoples in their own voices and on their own terms, instead of being represented by mainstream narratives. You will learn how Indigenous literatures negotiate issues of aesthetics and ethics, authenticity and identity, voice and representation, individual authorship and community narrative. Studying a diverse range of prose (fiction and non-fiction) and poetry from across the world, including from Australia, Canada, India and the US, you will learn how to understand these powerful literatures in a comparative framework. You will build upon critical analytical skills in literary studies that will help in understanding how Indigenous sovereignty is determined through Literature in the face of hegemonic discursive and representational practices.</synopsis>

<title> The archaeology of empires</title>
<synopsis> Towards the beginning of the first millennium BCE the Assyrian state in upper Mesopotamia started to expand its borders. Many territorial states had done this before, but the military and economic ideology of conquest that motivated this expansion created a new kind of political entity -the empire- which was to set the stage for the political strategy of the next one thousand years. When the Assyrian empire finally collapsed, its territory was quickly taken by the Babylonians and Medes, who in turn were conquered by the Persian Empire, which, after 200 years of dominion over a territory stretching from the Mediterranean to the mountains of Afghanistan, itself fell to the army of Alexander the Great and his generals. In this unit we will examine how the material culture recovered by archaeology - from the palaces, battle accounts, and art of the elite to the houses, pottery, and ritual figurines of those they conquered - can tell us how these early empires extended their power to neighbouring communities and how these communities adapted to, and sometimes resisted, the encroaching empires that surrounded them. Cultures covered include Egypt, Ancient Judah-Israel, Assyria, Urartu, Babylon, Media, Persia and the Hellenistic empires.</synopsis>

<title> Strategies in writing experiments</title>
<synopsis> The unit approaches creative writing in terms of its status as a product of processes of experimentation (as distinct from personal expression). Students will explore a range of strategies for experimenting with forms and with themes through a series of reading materials (short stories, excerpts from longer works, poetry, etc.) and writing exercises that are contextualised in varied social-political and cultural contexts. The major composition that is built on weekly exercises has a thematic focus that is student-driven and demonstrates the processes of researching, drafting and editing creative texts. The unit is oriented towards practical and critical application of advanced experimental strategies in creative writing so that students can better appreciate the extent of originality of style and content of their work in relation to that of published authors. Equally important is the appreciation of what these strategies aim to achieve both aesthetically and ideologically, and the pros and cons of their engagement. Finally, the unit is also oriented towards the production of effective and experimental writing, and the importance of reflecting on creative work through the critical techniques of exegesis.</synopsis>

<title> Stardom: Celebrity, society and power</title>
<synopsis> Since the early 20th century film stars have been a central feature of cinema and have attained a prominent place within broader culture and society. They appear in magazines, on billboards, on television programmes, and now have a strong presence on the internet. The importance of stars stems from their economic function within cinema, their contributions to the meanings and affects of films, and their ideological role in defining and shaping popular conceptions of identity in societies at particular points in time. This course will offer a thorough interrogation of the star phenomenon, combining theoretical work derived from the field of 'star studies' with empirical analyses of specific films and stars. A host of extra-filmic materials, such as magazine articles, interviews, film reviews and promotional materials will also be analysed as students seek to identity the defining features of a number of star personas. Topics covered will include the history of stardom from the silent 'gods and goddesses' to modern day television stars and celebrity culture; the ideological role of stars in circulating and revealing dominant attitudes to class, gender, sexuality and race/ethnicity; and the cultural and national specificities of stardom through case studies of American, French, Indian and Southeast Asian stars. In doing so, there will be emphasis on the contribution stars make to the pleasures of cinema, while remaining attentive to the political implications of these hugely popular and highly influential representations of selfhood.</synopsis>

<title> Advanced professional writing</title>
<synopsis> This unit aims to further develop students' professional communication capabilities, to assist students to apply knowledge and skills from an academic context to workplaces, and for students who have undertaken ATS1298  , to refine the language and communication abilities learned in the first year unit.   The primary focus of this unit is the development of an extended individual project focusing on analysis and development of communication in a current organization.  Further professional writing skills are developed through the documentation of the project (pitches and briefs, bench-marking and final delivery reports, written and oral).   As the expectations of communication in organisations and the modern world are also rapidly evolving, the unit is also designed to further students' conceptual understanding of key issues in professional communication such as multi-modal-literacy, inter-cultural communication, and changing practices of reading, writing and text creation.  This knowledge will complement students' work in other media and professional communication studies as it enables a consistent and thorough approach to media text construction.</synopsis>

<title> Screening contemporary Europe</title>
<synopsis> Europe is the birthplace of cinema, and from the silent era through to Italian neo-realism, to the new waves of the 1960s and 70s, European cinema changed the way we see and know the world. In this unit we trace the development of European cinema after the fall of the Berlin Wall and into the 21st century, asking three key questions: How have the changing boundaries and social crises in Europe in the post-Berlin Wall era impacted on cinema? What distinguishes European cinema from others in the global era? Can the cinema still be an appropriate media for reflecting cultures, identity and social change? We will study some of Europe's most influential contemporary films and documentaries. We will examine the tension between the rise of transnational European 'blockbuster' cinema, designed to compete with Hollywood, and traditional European art house filmmaking. We will consider the long-standing relationship between European cinema and the European tradition of film festivals. We will address issues of language, translation and subtitling. And we will also look at political and social implications of important emergent cinemas from this period, including a proliferation of immigrant films that are challenging traditional conceptions of European space and identity. Students will be introduced to films from a range of countries, including France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Hungary and Spain.</synopsis>

<synopsis> CHM1011 has been designed such that some previous understanding of chemistry is presumed, but is also underpinned by a support structure for those who are relatively new to the subject. The curriculum focuses on general and physical chemistry principles which in turn complements the synthetic chemistry topics discussed in the subsequent unit, CHM1022  . On completion of CHM1011, students will have gained an understanding of atomic structure, how atoms and molecules interact with each other and how this affects their bonding, reactivity, 3D structure and physical properties. A number of important topics such as stoichiometry, intermolecular forces, thermodynamics, kinetics, equilibria, and electrochemistry will be developed in order to prepare students for a deeper exploration of chemistry. The concepts developed within the workshops and tutorials are complemented through a laboratory program where students will have the opportunity to develop analytical techniques and design their own experiments to solve a range of chemical problems.</synopsis>

<synopsis> Physical chemistry provides insight into the fundamental reason that chemical systems and materials behave the way they do. This unit gives students an advanced understanding of the properties and characteristics of solids, liquids and gases from a fundamental level - utilising computation of individual atoms and bonds - right through to applied systems such as colloids and surfactants, relevant to minerals, food and formulation. The course follows a natural progression from atomic and molecular properties at a single atom or bond level through key thermodynamics to the properties of chemical systems, such as viscosity, phase behaviour and the interactions between solids and liquids. The final section deals with surfaces and colloids - key to understanding important chemical systems in Australian science and industry, due to their ubiquity in minerals processing, food and dairy industries, energy and oil, pharmaceuticals, water and waste processing.</synopsis>

<title> Expansion studies in design</title>
<synopsis> Design Practice as Research provides a platform for students to apply a range of skills and aptitudes towards practice-based research in design. Through an individualised course of study under the guidance of personal research mentors, participants will undertake projects using appropriate methodologies that demonstrate an independent point of view on the social, cultural, technological, and communicative aspects of design. The unit will enhance the combined creative and analytical methods of students as preparation for undertaking practice-based research while also promoting how processes of research and development can make an advanced contribution to contemporary design practice. The unit provides a unique opportunity for establishing interdisciplinary approaches to design research and the intersection of theory and practice. On occasion, these studies may be undertaken as part of an immersive research studio conducted as part of special projects and study abroad experiences.</synopsis>

<title> Leaders, power and politics</title>
<synopsis> Leadership is indispensable to politics. Yet leadership is a problematic concept within liberal democracies that have traditionally set out to devolve authority and check against concentrations of power. This unit explores political leadership within liberal democracies using Australia (prime ministers) and the United States (presidents) as its primary empirical reference points. It examines how political leadership has been theorised from classical to contemporary times, including the application of psychology to understand the motivations and classify the behavioural repertoires of leaders. The unit considers how leaders are constrained by context ('the times') and institutional settings. It asks whether leaders make history or are prisoners of it and why certain leaders become associated with transformative change. The unit also explores two of the fundamental functions of political leaders: persuasion and decision-making. It investigates whether it is possible to identify the qualities of successful political leadership. Finally, the unit takes stock of political leadership in the early twenty-first century: an era in which leaders have never seemed more central to politics and yet the challenges of leadership so great. Students will be given the opportunity to choose a leader on which to focus to explore the themes addressed in the unit.</synopsis>

<title> Working with families across the lifespan</title>
<synopsis> This unit introduces the concept of working with families from a strengths-based framework. The concept of family strengths has been studied for several decades and describes a family that functions optimally in support of the individual members. When nurses and other professionals use a family strengths theoretical framework in their daily practice, they contribute to providing health care that focuses on the whole rather than only the individual and begin to support families when accessing health care. A healthy family may be stronger in one area than another, and strengths may overlap with each other. It is well known that the family environment may have a positive or a negative effect on individuals in the family, depending on the family's values, beliefs, and ability to manage change. The composition and structure of contemporary families are wide-ranging, and include families from varying cultures, with composition including single and extended families, and families at differing socioeconomic levels. This unit aims to bridge the gap in theoretical content related to family care across the lifespan so that nurses and other professionals can explore the factors that shape their capacity to develop caring relationships with individuals, families, groups, populations, and communities.</synopsis>

<synopsis> Through seminars, workshops and fieldwork this unit will examine how conflict has been represented, remembered and memorialised. The unit will have a specific focus on World War 2, the Italian Resistance, and the massacre of civilians in Tuscany and Emilia Romagna. The unit will consider how written and visual responses to these events, material forms of remembrance - monuments, memorials, museums,  and cemeteries in, or within reach of Prato - each function to memorialise the dead and how in articulating political and national ideologies, such sites acknowledge and incorporate countervailing ideologies and the contradictory testimony of survivors. The unit will unpack, examine and critique the complex inter-relations between media, memory and war, exploring how in pursuit of specific political and cultural goals, memories of conflict are created, constructed and recovered through an array of artistic and memorial forms. Students will be invited to move beyond a purely theoretical understanding of these issues by visiting museums, massacre sites and their memorials, examining and critiquing their mediation and creating a critical/creative response to one such site.</synopsis>

<title> Research practices advanced</title>
<synopsis> Research Practices Advanced is a core unit in the Visual Arts sequence, and is the first of the two second year units. This unit is a practice driven, workshop based unit which develops a variety of methodologies and their contribution to a research practice in visual culture. It is designed to further develop, challenge and expand how students think about making artwork and to synthesise research interests, building on VPR1113  . A series of individual and collaborative exercises and projects are presented to extend and further foster creative research skills and consolidate students' material skills. The main emphasis of this class is to demonstrate how thinking operates through making. Fabrication processes in the workshop can be in any medium from across two- and/or three-dimensional works, to sound and performance. The aim of these exercises is to further extend each student's capacity for production, creating a pool of ideas, strategies, forms and processes for students to draw on and develop as they progress through the course. Teaching methodology involves critical dialogue, classroom discussion and peer review. This unit presents a broad range of approaches to contemporary art and its institutions for those wishing to work in the arts industry as artists, curators, arts writers, educators or practitioners. Research Practices encourages an experimental approach to conceptual, material and public outcomes. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication and materials are core values in the unit.</synopsis>

The emphasis here is on understanding CBT theory and the related techniques of intervention, understanding the psychological issues faced by clients, and bringing the two together in formulation. We start by introducing students to the theory of CBT and the process of assessment and formulation and how to structure therapy. Key CBT processes such as guided discovery and collaboration are highlighted. Then students are supported to learn and apply the core skills of CBT including cognitive restructuring, behavioural experiments, problem-solving and relaxation.

<title> Cultural diversity in contemporary Europe</title>
<synopsis> The unit, presented over a four week period, involves a research-led case study of cultural diversity in Europe. Based at Monash University's Prato Centre, students will be introduced to the main overarching theories concerning migration and cultural diversity. Within these overarching theories, students will also encounter numerous concepts and perspectives including among others, cosmopolitanism, assimilation, integration, multiculturalism, insider-outsider relations and the notion of 'othering'. Issues relating to race, culture, identity and citizenship will also be considered. The uniqueness of the unit and its relevance to the Prato setting is that students will use these theoretical underpinnings to frame a case study involving observational research to complete 3000 word case study concerning managing cultural diversity in Europe. Students will be encouraged to observe cultural similarities and differences, and particularly the interactions between different cultural groups. The unit aims to provide understandings of managing cultural diversity and a unique experience in undertaking observational research in a European setting. While the topic is a core focus and one of the research strengths in Sociology, it will appeal to students in a range of disciplines including those interested in international relations, law, criminology and Bachelor of Arts students in general.</synopsis>

It does this through the two-pronged approach of introducing terminology and notation systems for talking about language structures, and applying this knowledge to real-world language problems. Through a focus on phonetics and phonology (the sounds of speech) and morpho-syntax ('grammar') the unit gives students deeper insight into the workings of English, while also introducing data from a range of other languages for the purposes of comparison. Students also reflect on how utterances are given meaning (semantics and pragmatics) and the importance of contextual factors in determining whether an utterance is grammatically correct or appropriate.</synopsis>

<title> Democratic theory</title>
<synopsis> The idea of democracy is ubiquitous in the contemporary world - diverse regime types and institutional systems claim democratic credentials and democracy is widely accepted as the most legitimate system of government. But the ideal of 'rule by the people' is not easy to achieve, and faces particular difficulties in large-scale modern societies characterised by institutional complexity, pluralism/multiculturalism, and globalization. This unit considers what the ideal of democracy can mean in contemporary political life, and how (or whether) it can be institutionally achieved.</synopsis>

<title> Research for social work practice</title>
<synopsis> In all fields of contemporary social work, practitioners need the skills to effectively consume, produce and apply research knowledge, to ensure that actions are based on appropriate and critiqued evidence. Research is a powerful intervention tool through which change can be achieved with individuals, groups and communities. This unit is offered as part of the core requirements of the professional association, the Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW). Social work research is seen to be informed by a clear value base and driven to deliver socially constructive outcomes. The unit will explore research processes, presenting a structured approach to the implementation of a research proposal. There will be particular emphasis on research in practice, program evaluation,  and program development, as well as the ethical underpinnings of all research. The overall aim of this unit is to encourage students to become critically reflective, research minded practitioners, who contribute in an ongoing way to the knowledge base of the profession. Students will engage in a range of learning activities, including interactive lectures, workshops, cross-disciplinary masterclasses and integrated online learning. Students will focus on learning the language and terminology of research, within a reflective practice framework.</synopsis>

<title> Animal behaviour</title>
<synopsis> This unit deals with several key areas of animal behaviour. We investigate animal communication systems, with particular emphasis on how signals are produced, transmitted and received, their information content and how they are sometimes used in social manipulation. We then go on to explore the way in which behaviour develops during the animal's early life and the various influences that shape this development before moving on to examine the genetic regulation of behaviour, how behaviour evolves and how we can use comparative methods to study this process. The rest of the unit is then devoted to behavioural ecology which deals with the role of behaviour in the animal's interactions with its environment and the ways in which the environment shapes adaptive behaviour on an evolutionary time scale. Topics covered in this area include foraging and anti-predator behaviour, social organisation, mating systems and parental care.</synopsis>

<synopsis> Additive Manufacturing (AM) of polymeric materials is an important manufacturing platform for the fabrication of functional and customisable engineered products. This unit will provide an overview of existing additive manufacturing processes such as 'fused deposition modelling', 'stereolithography', 'polymer jetting' and 'powder bed fusion'. Each of these technologies relies on the appropriate selection of a polymer and the fundamentals of different classes of polymeric materials will be reviewed. Advantages and drawbacks of existing and emerging AM technologies will also be discussed. The unit will also investigate ex les of the use of these technologies for the design and fabrication of functional polymeric parts. The students will obtain practical skills in 3D printing of polymers, computer-aided design and processing of polymers for Additive Manufacturing.</synopsis>
