The unit will unpack, examine and critique the complex inter-relations between media, memory and war, exploring how in pursuit of specific political and cultural goals, memories of conflict are created, constructed and recovered through an array of artistic and memorial forms.

The Honours program has been structured to enable students to understand research in the context of the issues of interest of concern in a specific organisation or service area.

In the pre-modern era, the emotions or 'passions', such as love, desire, fear, and sadness, were seen as mental states that arose involuntarily in the soul as a result of its close connection with the body. They were commonly regarded as corrupting influences on an agent's moral choices and actions. To overcome their influence, philosophers recommended various techniques for either suppressing the passions or turning them into virtues or excellences of character. Following the Augustinian tradition, many regarded love as the key to transforming the passions. This unit explores the moral and metaphysical dimensions of this subject, with reference to both male and female philosophers of the past. Some of the thinkers who may be discussed include St Augustine, Rene Descartes, Elisabeth of Bohemia, Mary Astell, and David Hume. Some of the themes in the unit may be followed into contemporary philosophical discussions.",

We explore their underlying causes including: globalisation, transnational trade, tourism, rapid development, social and political transitions, climate change, violence and insecurity. Using research reports and field experience from practical projects, we examine the wider context for working in international settings as well as the issues faced by Indigenous peoples, migrants and refugees. We explore our responsibilities as 'global citizens' and we challenge you to think about ways you could make a difference.",

This unit enables students to produce self-initiated performance work in creative teams. Students will gain tools and strategies for team working, for production management, and for documenting and evaluating their own work and that of others. As well as practical projects, students will undertake readings, presentations, and work on performance documentation to demonstrate their integration of the theories of performance into their practical research.",

Intervention principles will also incorporate environmental supports and barriers (advocacy, organisational change, environmental adaptation) and evidence-based practice. The common characteristics of primary care will form the framework including issues of expanded access, multi-professional service teams, optimal service coordination, and a focus on patient empowerment and the application of technology to health promotion. Prevention and health promotion systems relevant to primary care will be examined, and the evidence and theoretical base for preventive (behavioural) counselling, brief interventions, health education practice, methods of tailoring strategies to client needs, motivational interviewing techniques, motivating change and preventing relapse will be explored. Approaches to adopting health promotion strategies and building capacity for health promotion in others will be explored.",

The tectonic settings of ore deposits are considered within the context of the plate tectonic paradigm, and global metallogenic events throughout Earth's history. This includes a brief introduction to the minerals industry, including mining and exploration practices. Practical classes will examine s le sets from around the world and focus on developing and understanding of ore deposit genesis, and on developing skills suitable for the minerals industry. Fieldwork consists of an excursion to examine the ore deposits of Victoria.",

Design Thinking brings together some approaches that are known in the sciences and humanities, such as analysis and synthesis, but applies them in ways that are particular to a design approach.  Design Thinking can enable a more flexible approach to problems, and a more nuanced engagement with the complex issues of our contemporary world. This unit will introduce students to the key skills and practices associated with Design Thinking, and offer opportunities to explore the application of these basic creativity techniques.

General principles and issues are embedded within case studies from a range of regions and language families. The seminar combines lectures with group discussion of key concepts guided by focus questions.",

The unit will deal with issues of identity, gender, sexuality and difference, drawing on performative theories of subjectivity. It will look closely at experimental art practices and how these practices have sought to close the gap between art and life; from the Happenings of the 1960s, through the body art of the 1960s and 70s, to relational aesthetics, and flash mob performance works in the 2000s.

You will learn how Indigenous literatures negotiate issues of aesthetics and ethics, authenticity and identity, voice and representation, individual authorship and community narrative. Studying a diverse range of prose (fiction and non-fiction) and poetry from across the world, including from Australia, Canada, India and the US, you will learn how to understand these powerful literatures in a comparative framework.

Many territorial states had done this before, but the military and economic ideology of conquest that motivated this expansion created a new kind of political entity -the empire- which was to set the stage for the political strategy of the next one thousand years. When the Assyrian empire finally collapsed, its territory was quickly taken by the Babylonians and Medes, who in turn were conquered by the Persian Empire, which, after 200 years of dominion over a territory stretching from the Mediterranean to the mountains of Afghanistan, itself fell to the army of Alexander the Great and his generals. In this unit we will examine how the material culture recovered by archaeology - from the palaces, battle accounts, and art of the elite to the houses, pottery, and ritual figurines of those they conquered - can tell us how these early empires extended their power to neighbouring communities and how these communities adapted to, and sometimes resisted, the encroaching empires that surrounded them. Cultures covered include Egypt, Ancient Judah-Israel, Assyria, Urartu, Babylon, Media, Persia and the Hellenistic empires.",

Students will explore a range of strategies for experimenting with forms and with themes through a series of reading materials (short stories, excerpts from longer works, poetry, etc.) and writing exercises that are contextualised in varied social-political and cultural contexts. The major composition that is built on weekly exercises has a thematic focus that is student-driven and demonstrates the processes of researching, drafting and editing creative texts. The unit is oriented towards practical and critical application of advanced experimental strategies in creative writing so that students can better appreciate the extent of originality of style and content of their work in relation to that of published authors. Equally important is the appreciation of what these strategies aim to achieve both aesthetically and ideologically, and the pros and cons of their engagement. Finally, the unit is also oriented towards the production of effective and experimental writing, and the importance of reflecting on creative work through the critical techniques of exegesis.",

They appear in magazines, on billboards, on television programmes, and now have a strong presence on the internet. The importance of stars stems from their economic function within cinema, their contributions to the meanings and affects of films, and their ideological role in defining and shaping popular conceptions of identity in societies at particular points in time. This course will offer a thorough interrogation of the star phenomenon, combining theoretical work derived from the field of 'star studies' with empirical analyses of specific films and stars. A host of extra-filmic materials, such as magazine articles, interviews, film reviews and promotional materials will also be analysed as students seek to identity the defining features of a number of star personas. Topics covered will include the history of stardom from the silent 'gods and goddesses' to modern day television stars and celebrity culture; the ideological role of stars in circulating and revealing dominant attitudes to class, gender, sexuality and race/ethnicity; and the cultural and national specificities of stardom through case studies of American, French, Indian and Southeast Asian stars. In doing so, there will be emphasis on the contribution stars make to the pleasures of cinema, while remaining attentive to the political implications of these hugely popular and highly influential representations of selfhood.",

The primary focus of this unit is the development of an extended individual project focusing on analysis and development of communication in a current organization.  Further professional writing skills are developed through the documentation of the project (pitches and briefs, bench-marking and final delivery reports, written and oral).   As the expectations of communication in organisations and the modern world are also rapidly evolving, the unit is also designed to further students' conceptual understanding of key issues in professional communication such as multi-modal-literacy, inter-cultural communication, and changing practices of reading, writing and text creation.  This knowledge will complement students' work in other media and professional communication studies as it enables a consistent and thorough approach to media text construction.",

In this unit we trace the development of European cinema after the fall of the Berlin Wall and into the 21st century, asking three key questions: How have the changing boundaries and social crises in Europe in the post-Berlin Wall era impacted on cinema? What distinguishes European cinema from others in the global era? Can the cinema still be an appropriate media for reflecting cultures, identity and social change? We will study some of Europe's most influential contemporary films and documentaries. We will examine the tension between the rise of transnational European 'blockbuster' cinema, designed to compete with Hollywood, and traditional European art house filmmaking. We will consider the long-standing relationship between European cinema and the European tradition of film festivals. We will address issues of language, translation and subtitling. And we will also look at political and social implications of important emergent cinemas from this period, including a proliferation of immigrant films that are challenging traditional conceptions of European space and identity. Students will be introduced to films from a range of countries, including France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Hungary and Spain.",

In this unit we trace the development of European cinema after the fall of the Berlin Wall and into the 21st century, asking three key questions: How have the changing boundaries and social crises in Europe in the post-Berlin Wall era impacted on cinema? What distinguishes European cinema from others in the global era? Can the cinema still be an appropriate media for reflecting cultures, identity and social change? We will study some of Europe's most influential contemporary films and documentaries. We will examine the tension between the rise of transnational European 'blockbuster' cinema, designed to compete with Hollywood, and traditional European art house filmmaking. We will consider the long-standing relationship between European cinema and the European tradition of film festivals. We will address issues of language, translation and subtitling. And we will also look at political and social implications of important emergent cinemas from this period, including a proliferation of immigrant films that are challenging traditional conceptions of European space and identity. Students will be introduced to films from a range of countries, including France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Hungary and Spain.",

On completion of CHM1011, students will have gained an understanding of atomic structure, how atoms and molecules interact with each other and how this affects their bonding, reactivity, 3D structure and physical properties. A number of important topics such as stoichiometry, intermolecular forces, thermodynamics, kinetics, equilibria, and electrochemistry will be developed in order to prepare students for a deeper exploration of chemistry. The concepts developed within the workshops and tutorials are complemented through a laboratory program where students will have the opportunity to develop analytical techniques and design their own experiments to solve a range of chemical problems.",

The course follows a natural progression from atomic and molecular properties at a single atom or bond level through key thermodynamics to the properties of chemical systems, such as viscosity, phase behaviour and the interactions between solids and liquids. The final section deals with surfaces and colloids - key to understanding important chemical systems in Australian science and industry, due to their ubiquity in minerals processing, food and dairy industries, energy and oil, pharmaceuticals, water and waste processing.",

It examines how political leadership has been theorised from classical to contemporary times, including the application of psychology to understand the motivations and classify the behavioural repertoires of leaders. The unit considers how leaders are constrained by context ('the times') and institutional settings. It asks whether leaders make history or are prisoners of it and why certain leaders become associated with transformative change. The unit also explores two of the fundamental functions of political leaders: persuasion and decision-making. It investigates whether it is possible to identify the qualities of successful political leadership. Finally, the unit takes stock of political leadership in the early twenty-first century: an era in which leaders have never seemed more central to politics and yet the challenges of leadership so great. Students will be given the opportunity to choose a leader on which to focus to explore the themes addressed in the unit.",

The concept of family strengths has been studied for several decades and describes a family that functions optimally in support of the individual members. When nurses and other professionals use a family strengths theoretical framework in their daily practice, they contribute to providing health care that focuses on the whole rather than only the individual and begin to support families when accessing health care. A healthy family may be stronger in one area than another, and strengths may overlap with each other. It is well known that the family environment may have a positive or a negative effect on individuals in the family, depending on the family's values, beliefs, and ability to manage change. The composition and structure of contemporary families are wide-ranging, and include families from varying cultures, with composition including single and extended families, and families at differing socioeconomic levels. This unit aims to bridge the gap in theoretical content related to family care across the lifespan so that nurses and other professionals can explore the factors that shape their capacity to develop caring relationships with individuals, families, groups, populations, and communities.",

This includes initial thoughts and conceptions, clarification in response to practical problem solving, representation as vivid and clear images capable of being presented to a commissioning body or regulatory agency.",

The unit will unpack, examine and critique the complex inter-relations between media, memory and war, exploring how in pursuit of specific political and cultural goals, memories of conflict are created, constructed and recovered through an array of artistic and memorial forms.

This unit is a practice driven, workshop based unit which develops a variety of methodologies and their contribution to a research practice in visual culture. It is designed to further develop, challenge and expand how students think about making artwork and to synthesise research interests, building on VPR1113  . A series of individual and collaborative exercises and projects are presented to extend and further foster creative research skills and consolidate students' material skills. The main emphasis of this class is to demonstrate how thinking operates through making. Fabrication processes in the workshop can be in any medium from across two- and/or three-dimensional works, to sound and performance. The aim of these exercises is to further extend each student's capacity for production, creating a pool of ideas, strategies, forms and processes for students to draw on and develop as they progress through the course. Teaching methodology involves critical dialogue, classroom discussion and peer review. This unit presents a broad range of approaches to contemporary art and its institutions for those wishing to work in the arts industry as artists, curators, arts writers, educators or practitioners. Research Practices encourages an experimental approach to conceptual, material and public outcomes. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication and materials are core values in the unit.",

The emphasis here is on understanding CBT theory and the related techniques of intervention, understanding the psychological issues faced by clients, and bringing the two together in formulation. We start by introducing students to the theory of CBT and the process of assessment and formulation and how to structure therapy. Key CBT processes such as guided discovery and collaboration are highlighted. Then students are supported to learn and apply the core skills of CBT including cognitive restructuring, behavioural experiments, problem-solving and relaxation. Finally, these tools and techniques are applied to clients across the age range with cognitive impairment, depression, anger, and anxiety.",

Within these overarching theories, students will also encounter numerous concepts and perspectives including among others, cosmopolitanism, assimilation, integration, multiculturalism, insider-outsider relations and the notion of 'othering'. Issues relating to race, culture, identity and citizenship will also be considered. The uniqueness of the unit and its relevance to the Prato setting is that students will use these theoretical underpinnings to frame a case study involving observational research to complete 3000 word case study concerning managing cultural diversity in Europe. Students will be encouraged to observe cultural similarities and differences, and particularly the interactions between different cultural groups. The unit aims to provide understandings of managing cultural diversity and a unique experience in undertaking observational research in a European setting. While the topic is a core focus and one of the research strengths in Sociology, it will appeal to students in a range of disciplines including those interested in international relations, law, criminology and Bachelor of Arts students in general.",

Social work research is seen to be informed by a clear value base and driven to deliver socially constructive outcomes. The unit will explore research processes, presenting a structured approach to the implementation of a research proposal. There will be particular emphasis on research in practice, program evaluation,  and program development, as well as the ethical underpinnings of all research. The overall aim of this unit is to encourage students to become critically reflective, research minded practitioners, who contribute in an ongoing way to the knowledge base of the profession. Students will engage in a range of learning activities, including interactive lectures, workshops, cross-disciplinary masterclasses and integrated online learning.

We investigate animal communication systems, with particular emphasis on how signals are produced, transmitted and received, their information content and how they are sometimes used in social manipulation. We then go on to explore the way in which behaviour develops during the animal's early life and the various influences that shape this development before moving on to examine the genetic regulation of behaviour, how behaviour evolves and how we can use comparative methods to study this process. The rest of the unit is then devoted to behavioural ecology which deals with the role of behaviour in the animal's interactions with its environment and the ways in which the environment shapes adaptive behaviour on an evolutionary time scale. Topics covered in this area include foraging and anti-predator behaviour, social organisation, mating systems and parental care.",
